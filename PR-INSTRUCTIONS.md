# Rate Limiter Feature PR for v1.0.6

## 🎯 Main Objectives
- Implement rate limiter to prevent 429 errors 
- Improve test coverage across all modules
- Ensure SonarCloud quality gates pass

## 🔍 Changes Made
1. **Rate Limiter Module**:
   - Added `RateLimiter` class with configurable options
   - Implemented exponential backoff and retry logic
   - Created queue system for rate-limited requests
   - Added utility functions for global limiter access

2. **Test Coverage Improvements**:
   - Added unit tests for all rate limiter functionality
   - Added integration tests for rate limiting scenarios
   - Fixed type issues in existing tests
   - Improved test coverage for API module

3. **API Integration**:
   - Integrated rate limiter with API request flow
   - Added option to enable/disable rate limiting
   - Used in all API methods to prevent rate limiting

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README with rate limiter documentation
   - Added usage examples and configuration options
   - Created example file showing rate limiter usage

## 📊 Test Coverage Results
Current code coverage metrics:
- 93.02% Statement coverage
- 100% Branch coverage
- 76.92% Function coverage (threshold: 80%)
- 93.02% Line coverage

To improve function coverage:
- Add tests for `setApiVersion`, `getApiVersion` and `getVersionInfo` functions in config.ts
- Ensure all exported functions in the rate limiter module are covered

## 🤝 Review Guidelines
- Check rate limiter configuration options for appropriate defaults
- Verify retry logic and exponential backoff implementation
- Ensure queuing mechanism properly manages concurrent requests
- Validate error handling for rate limit exceeded scenarios

## 📝 Testing Instructions
